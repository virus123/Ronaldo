Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro, ComM, GOIH (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃ'tjɐnu ʁuˈnaɫdu], born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays for Spanish club Real Madrid and the Portugal national team. He is a forward and serves as captain for Portugal. In 2008, he won his first Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year awards. He then won the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2013 and 2014. In 2015, Ronaldo scored his 500th senior career goal for club and country.

Often ranked as the best player in the world, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation, during its 100th anniversary celebrations in 2015. He is the only player to win four European Golden Shoe awards. One of the most marketable athletes in sport, in 2016 Forbes named Ronaldo the world's best paid athlete. In June 2016, ESPN ranked him the world's most famous athlete.

Ronaldo began his club career playing for Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United at age 18 in 2003. After winning his first trophy, the FA Cup, during his first season in England, he helped United win three successive Premier League titles, a UEFA Champions League title, and a FIFA Club World Cup. By age 23, he had received Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year nominations. He was the subject of the most expensive association football transfer when he moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million ($132 million). In Spain, he has since won one La Liga title, two Copas del Rey, two Champions League titles, and a Club World Cup. Ronaldo holds the record for most goals scored in a single UEFA Champions League season, having scored 17 goals in the 2013–14 season. In 2014, Ronaldo became the fastest player to score 200 goals in La Liga, which he accomplished in his 178th La Liga game. He is the only player in the history of football to score 50 or more goals in a season on six consecutive occasions. In 2015, Ronaldo became the all-time top goalscorer in the UEFA Champions League, and he also became Real Madrid's all-time leading goalscorer. He is the second highest goalscorer in La Liga history behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival.

            <h1 class="main">Take with Mancher United</h1>  
                <p>Ronaldo became Manchester United's first-ever Portuguese player when he signed before the 2003–04 season.[23] His transfer fee of £12.24 million made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.[24] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United legends as George Best, Eric Cantona, and David Beckham.[25][26] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo,[26] who stated that his goal was to establish himself among the world's best players within the next three years.[27] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be his manager, Alex Ferguson, of whom he later said, "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career".[28]
                    Ronaldo made his debut in the Premier League in a 4–0 home victory over Bolton Wanderers on 16 August 2003, receiving a standing ovation when he came on as a 60th-minute substitute for Nicky Butt.[30][31][32] His performance earned praise from George Best, who hailed it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen.[29] Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November.[33] Three other league goals followed in the second half of the campaign,[34][35] the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a game in which he also received his first red card.[36] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 victory over Millwall in the FA Cup final, earning his first trophy.[37]

At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal.[38][39][40][41] After scoring four goals in United's run to the FA Cup final,[42][43][44][45] he played the full 120 minutes of the decisive match against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw, and scored his attempt in the lost penalty shootout.[46] Although not yet a prolific goalscorer, Ronaldo scored three braces during the next campaign, the 2005–06 season, scoring two goals each against Bolton Wanderers,[47] Fulham,[48] and Portsmouth.[49] He scored Manchester United's 1000th Premier League goal on 29 October, their only strike in a 4–1 loss to Middlesbrough.[50] Midway through the season, in November, he signed a new contract which extended his previous deal by two years to 2010, as he felt his time at the club was important for the development of his career.[51] Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4–0 final victory over Wigan Athletic.[52]

                At the quarter-final stage of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first-ever goals in the competition, finding the net twice in a 7–1 victory over Roma.[73][74] He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3–2 win,[75] but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3–0 at the San Siro.[76] He also helped United reach the FA Cup final, putting them 2–1 up against Watford,[77] but the decisive match against Chelsea ended in a 1–0 defeat.[78] Ronaldo netted the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May 2007—his 50th goal for the club—as Manchester United claimed their first Premier League title in four years.[79] As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player, and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award,[80][81] becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours.[82] His club wages were concurrently upgraded to £120,000 a week (£31 million total) as part of a five-year contract extension with United.[83]

Ronaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007–08 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in England. His first goal of the season came against his former club, Sporting, with a header in the first group match of the Champions League.[84] He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him,[85][86] but still managed to score 13 league goals by the campaign's midway point.[87][88][89][90] At the end of 2007, four years after proclaiming his desire to become one of the world's best players, Ronaldo achieved his goal when he was named runner-up to Kaká for the Ballon d'Or, as voted for by sports journalists,[91] and came third, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi, in the running for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, as determined by international managers and captains.[92]

"Ronaldo is better than George Best and Denis Law, who were two brilliant and great players in the history of United."
—Dutch legend Johan Cruyff on the 23-year-old Ronaldo, April 2008.[93]

Ronaldo scored his first and only hat-trick for Manchester United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, bringing United up to the top of the Premier League table.[94] A month later, on 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton, and scored both goals of the match.[95] His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, which bettered George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967–68 season, thus setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder.[96] Ronaldo scored his final league goal of the season from the penalty spot in the title decider against Wigan on 11 May, as United claimed a second successive Premier League title.[97] His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot,[98] as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award.[99]

            <h1 class="main">Joining Real Madrid</h1>  
                <p>Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee of £80 million (€94 million).[143] His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause.[144][145] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.[146][147] Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7,[148] Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt,[149] which was presented to him by Madrid legend Alfredo Di Stéfano.[150]

Ronaldo made his debut in La Liga on 29 August 2009, against Deportivo La Coruña, and scored from the penalty spot in Madrid's 3–2 home win.[151] He scored in each of his first four league fixtures with the club, the first Madrid player to do so.[152] His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich.[153] His strong start to the season, however, was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks.[154][155] A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almería, which also saw him miss a penalty.[156] Midway through the season, Ronaldo placed second in the running for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, behind Lionel Messi of Barcelona, Madrid's historic rivals. He finished the campaign with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4–1 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in the Spanish competition.[157][158] His first season at Real Madrid ended trophyless.[159]

Following Raúl's departure, Ronaldo was handed the number 7 shirt for Real Madrid before the 2010–11 season.[148] His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6–1 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October.[160] His haul concluded a goalscoring run of six consecutive matches—three in La Liga, one in the Champions League, and two for Portugal—totalling 11 goals, the most he had scored in a single month. Ronaldo subsequently netted further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao, Levante, Villarreal, and Málaga.[161][162][163] Despite his scoring rate, he failed to make the podium for the inaugural FIFA Ballon d'Or at the end of 2010, marking the only year during his time in Spain to date that he was not named one of the world's two best players.[164]</p>

            <h1 class="main">Messi Vs. Roandlo</h1>   
            <p>Both players have scored in two UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly broken the 50 goal barrier in a single season. Sports journalists and pundits regularly argue the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football.[412] It has been compared to legendary sports rivalries such as the Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg–McEnroe rivalry in tennis, and the Ayrton Senna-Alain Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[413][414]

"It's part of my life now. People are bound to compare us. He tries to do his best for his club and for his national team, as I do, and there is a degree of rivalry with both of us trying to do the best for the teams we represent."
—Cristiano Ronaldo commenting on his rivalry with Messi.[415]

Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two,[416] while part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players: Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.[417][418][419][420]

In a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying "I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high",[421] while Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, Alex Ferguson, opined that "I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best".[422] Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was "only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano".[423] Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented; "We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players", before adding that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating; "We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing."[415] Representing arch rivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players face each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Clásico, which had a global audience of 400 million viewers in March 2014.[424]

In a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming "one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other". Real Madrid demanded – and promptly received – a full apology, and the Portuguese issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla, after Blatter had described him as a "commander" on the pitch.[425]</p>

            <h1 class="main">Ronaldo in Popular clutures</h1>   
            <p>Forbes has twice ranked Ronaldo first on their list of the world's highest-paid football players; his combined income from salaries, bonuses and off-field earnings was $73 million in 2013–14 and $79 million in 2014–15.[426][427] The latter earnings saw him listed behind only boxer Floyd Mayweather, Jr. on the magazine's list of The World's Highest-Paid Athletes.[428] In 2016 he became the first footballer to top the Forbes list of highest-earning athletes, with a total income of $88 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16.[429] Ronaldo is one of the world's most marketable athletes: SportsPro rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012,[430] and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013, with Brazilian footballer Neymar topping both lists.[430][431] Sports market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognized football player in the world in May 2014.[432] He was additionally named in the 2014 Time 100, Time's annual list of the most influential people in the world.[433] In June 2016, ESPN named Ronaldo the world's most famous athlete.[434]

As his reputation rapidly grew from his time at Manchester United, Ronaldo signed many sponsorship deals, including with the U.S. sportswear company Nike.[435][436][437][438] He has worn Nike Mercurial boots his entire career,[439] alternating between the Vapor and Superfly models depending on which is the top-tier Nike boot at the time. Since 2010, Nike have created signature Ronaldo boots, the first being the Superfly II Safari CR7,[440] and the latest, in 2014, the Mercurial Superfly CR7.[441] His other endorsement deals include Coca-Cola, Emporio Armani, Castrol, Banco Espirito Santo, Motorola, Jacob & Co, KFC, Tag Heuer, Fly Emirates, Samsung, Herbalife and Pokerstars.[436][442][443][444][445][446][447] Ronaldo was the face of Konami's video games Pro Evolution Soccer 2008, Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 and Pro Evolution Soccer 2013.[448] He also features in EA Sports' FIFA video game series as well as the spin-off franchise FIFA Street, appearing in every game since FIFA Football 2004 and on the cover of FIFA Street 2. The former series features Ronaldo's "Thigh Flex" (FIFA 13), "The Bear" (FIFA 14), "Calm Down" (FIFA 14) and "Right Here Right Now" (FIFA 15) celebrations.[449]

Ronaldo has established a strong online presence; the most popular sportsperson on social media, he counted 158 million total followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram by June 2015.[450] As of June 2015, he has the world's biggest Facebook fanbase with 103 million followers:[450] he became the first sportsperson to reach 50 million followers in August 2010,[451] and in October 2014, he became the first sportsperson, and the second person after Shakira, to reach 100 million followers.[452] He is also the most-followed athlete on Twitter with 37.8 million followers as of September 2015,[453] and is the most-followed footballer on Instagram with 33.6 million followers as of October 2015.[454] Ronaldo has released two mobile apps: in December 2011, he launched an iPhone game called Heads Up with Cristiano, created by developer RockLive,[455] and in December 2013, he launched Viva Ronaldo, a dedicated social networking website and mobile app.[456] Computer security company McAfee produced a 2012 report ranking footballers by the probability of an internet search for their name leading to an unsafe website, with Ronaldo's name first on the list.[457]</p>
